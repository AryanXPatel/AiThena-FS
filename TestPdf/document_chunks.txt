The  plot\nform  may  be  comic,  tragic,  romantic  or  satiric.\nThe  central  incident  is  selected  to  manifest,  as\nmuch  as  possible,  the  protagonist’s  life  and\ncharacter,  and  the  details  contribute  to  the\ndevelopment of the plot.\nThe term ‘short story’ covers a great diversity of\nprose  fiction,  right  from  the  really  short  ‘short\nstory’ of about five hundred words to longer and\nmore complex works. The longer ones, with their\nstatus of middle length, fall between the tautness\nof the short narrative and the expansiveness of\nthe novel.\nThere can be thematic variation too. The stories\ndeal  with  fantasy,  reality,  alienation  and  the\nproblem of choice in personal life. There are three\nshort  stories  and  two  long  ones  in  this  section\nrepresenting writers from five cultures.\nReprint 2025-26","2/KALEIDOSCOPE\nI SI S\nI SI S\nI S\nell my Dreamsell my Dreams\nell my Dreamsell my Dreams\nell my Dreams\nGabriel  Garcia  Marquez  was  brought  up  by  his\ngrandparents in Northern Columbia because his\nparents were poor and struggling. A novelist, short-\nstory writer and journalist, he is widely considered\nthe greatest living Latin American master of narrative.\nMarquez won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982.\nHis  two  masterpieces  are  One Hundred Years in\nSolitude (1967, tr. 1970) and Love in The Time of\nCholera (1985, tr. 1988). His themes are violence,\nsolitude and the overwhelming human need for love.\nThis story reflects, like most of his works, a high\npoint in Latin American magical realism; it is rich\nand lucid, mixing reality with fantasy.\nOne morning at nine o’clock, while we were having breakfast\non  the  terrace  of  the  Havana  Riviera  Hotel  under  a  bright\nsun, a huge wave picked up several cars that were driving\ndown  the  avenue  along  the  seawall  or  parked  on  the\npavement,  and  embedded  one  of  them  in  the  side  of  the\nhotel. It was like an explosion of dynamite that sowed panic\non  all  twenty  floors  of  the  building  and  turned  the  great\nentrance  window  to  dust.  The  many  tourists  in  the  lobby\nwere  thrown  into  the  air  along  with  the  furniture,  and\nsome  were  cut  by  the  hailstorm  of  glass.  The  wave  must\nhave  been  immense,  because  it  leaped  over  the  wide  two-\nway street between the seawall and the hotel and still had\nenough  force  to  shatter  the  window.\nThe  cheerful  Cuban  volunteers,  with  the  help  of  the\nfire department, picked up the debris in less than six hours,\nand  sealed  off  the  gate  to  the  sea  and  installed  another,\n11\n11\n1\nGabriel  Garcia  Marquez\n1927-2014\nReprint 2025-26","3/I SELL MY DREAMS\nand  everything  returned  to  normal.  During  the  morning\nnobody  worried  about  the  car  encrusted  in  the  wall,  for\npeople  assumed  it  was  one  of  those  that  had  been  parked\non  the  pavement.  But  when  the  crane  lifted  it  out  of  its\nsetting,  the  body  of  a  woman  was  found  secured  behind\nthe  steering  wheel  by  a  seat  belt.  The  blow  had  been  so\nbrutal  that  not  a  single  one  of  her  bones  was  left  whole.\nHer  face  was  destroyed,  her  boots  had  been  ripped  apart,\nand her clothes were in shreds. She wore a gold ring shaped\nlike  a  serpent,  with  emerald  eyes.  The  police  established\nthat  she  was  the  housekeeper  for  the  new  Portuguese\nambassador  and  his  wife.  She  had  come  to  Havana  with\nthem  two  weeks  before  and  had  left  that  morning  for  the\nmarket, driving a new car. Her name meant nothing to me\nwhen I read it in the newspaper, but I was intrigued by the\nsnake  ring  and  its  emerald  eyes.  I  could  not  find  out,\nhowever,  on  which  finger  she  wore  it.\nThis was a crucial piece of information, because I feared\nshe  was  an  unforgettable  woman  whose  real  name  I  never\nknew,  and  who  wore  a  similar  ring  on  her  right  forefinger\nwhich,  in  those  days,  was  even  more  unusual  than  it  is\nnow.  I  had  met  her  thirty-four  years  earlier  in  Vienna,\neating sausage with boiled potatoes and drinking draft beer\nin  a  tavern  frequented  by  Latin  American  students.  I  had\ncome  from  Rome  that  morning,  and  I  still  remember  my\nimmediate  response  to  her  splendid  soprano’s  bosom,  the\nlanguid  foxtails  on  her  coat  collar,  and  that  Egyptian  ring\nin the shape of a serpent. She spoke an elementary Spanish\nin  a  metallic  accent  without  pausing  for  breath,  and  I\nthought  she  was  the  only  Austrian  at  the  long  wooden\ntable.  But  no,  she  had  been  born  in  Colombia  and  had\ncome  to  Austria  between  the  wars,  when  she  was  little\nmore  than  a  child,  to  study  music  and  voice.  She  was\nabout  thirty,  and  did  not  carry  her  years  well,  for  she  had\nnever  been  pretty  and  had  begun  to  age  before  her  time.\nBut  she  was  a  charming  human  being.  And  one  of  the\nmost  awe-inspiring.\nVienna  was  still  an  old  imperial  city,  whose\ngeographical position between the two irreconcilable worlds\nleft  behind  by  the  Second  World  War  had  turned  it  into  a\nReprint 2025-26","4/KALEIDOSCOPE\nparadise of black marketeering and international espionage.\nI  could  not  have  imagined  a  more  suitable  spot  for  my\nfugitive  compatriot,  who  still  ate  in  the  students’  tavern\non  the  corner  only  out  of  loyalty  to  her  origins,  since  she\nhad  more  than  enough  money  to  buy  meals  for  all  her\ntable  companions.  She  never  told  her  real  name,  and  we\nalways  knew  her  by  the  Germanic  tongue  twister  that  we\nLatin  American  students  in  Vienna  invented  for  her:  Frau\nFrieda. I had just been introduced to her when I committed\nthe happy impertinence of asking how she had come to be\nin  a  world  so  distant  and  different  from  the  windy  cliffs  of\nQuindio,  and  she  answered  with  a  devastating:\n‘I  sell  my  dreams.’\nIn  reality,  that  was  her  only  trade.  She  had  been  the\nthird  of  eleven  children  born  to  a  prosperous  shopkeeper\nin  old  Caldas,  and  as  soon  as  she  learned  to  speak  she\ninstituted  the  fine  custom  in  her  family  of  telling  dreams\nbefore  breakfast,  the  time  when  their  oracular  qualities\nare  preserved  in  their  purest  form.  When  she  was  seven\nshe  dreamed  that  one  of  her  brothers  was  carried  off  by  a\nflood.  Her  mother,  out  of  sheer  religious  superstition,\nforbade  the  boy  to  swim  in  the  ravine,  which  was  his\nfavourite  pastime.  But  Frau  Frieda  already  had  her  own\nsystem  of  prophecy.\n‘What  that  dream  means,’  she  said,  ‘isn’t  that  he’s\ngoing  to  drown,  but  that  he  shouldn’t  eat  sweets.’\nHer  interpretation  seemed  an  infamy  to  a  five-year-old\nboy  who  could  not  live  without  his  Sunday  treats.  Their\nmother,  convinced  of  her  daughter’s  oracular  talents,\nenforced  the  warning  with  an  iron  hand.  But  in  her  first\ncareless moment the boy choked on a piece of caramel that\nhe was eating in secret, and there was no way to save him.\nFrau Frieda did not think she could earn a living with\nher  talent  until  life  caught  her  by  the  throat  during  the\ncruel  Viennese  winters.  Then  she  looked  for  work  at  the\nfirst  house  where  she  would  have  liked  to  live,  and  when\nshe was asked what she could do, she told only the truth:\n‘I  dream.’  A  brief  explanation  to  the  lady  of  the  house  was\nall  she  needed,  and  she  was  hired  at  a  salary  that  just\nReprint 2025-26","5/I SELL MY DREAMS\ncovered  her  minor  expenses,  but  she  had  a  nice  room  and\nthree meals a day—breakfast in particular, when the family\nsat  down  to  learn  the  immediate  future  of  each  of  its\nmembers:  the  father,  a  refined  financier;  the  mother,  a\njoyful  woman  passionate  about  Romantic  chamber  music;\nand  two  children,  eleven  and  nine  years  old.  They  were  all\nreligious  and  therefore  inclined  to  archaic  superstitions,\nand  they  were  delighted  to  take  in  Frau  Frieda,  whose\nonly  obligation  was  to  decipher  the  family’s  daily  fate\nthrough  her  dreams.\nShe  did  her  job  well,  and  for  a  long  time,  above  all\nduring  the  war  years,  when  reality  was  more  sinister  than\nnightmares.  Only  she  could  decide  at  breakfast  what  each\nshould  do  that  day,  and  how  it  should  be  done,  until  her\npredictions  became  the  sole  authority  in  the  house.  Her\ncontrol over the family was absolute: even the faintest sigh\nwas  breathed  by  her  order.  The  master  of  the  house  died\nat about the time I was in Vienna, and had the elegance to\nleave  her  a  part  of  his  estate  on  the  condition  that  she\ncontinue  dreaming  for  the  family  until  her  dreams  came\nto an end.\nI stayed in Vienna for more than a month, sharing the\nstraitened  circumstances  of  the  other  students  while  I\nwaited  for  money  that  never  arrived.  Frau  Frieda’s\nunexpected  and  generous  visits  to  the  tavern  were  like\nfiestas in our poverty-stricken regime. One night, in a beery\neuphoria,  she  whispered  in  my  ear  with  a  conviction  that\npermitted  no  delay.\n‘I  only  came  to  tell  you  that  I  dreamed  about  you  last\nnight,’  she  said.  ‘You  must  leave  right  away  and  not  come\nback  to  Vienna  for  five  years.’\nHer conviction was so real that I boarded the last train\nto Rome that same night. As for me, I was so influenced by\nwhat  she  said  that  from  then  on  I  considered  myself  a\nsurvivor  of  some  catastrophe  I  never  experienced.

It  happened  on  the  day  Pablo\nNeruda stepped on Spanish soil for the first time since the\nCivil  War,  on  a  stopover  during  a  long  sea  voyage  to\nValparaiso.  He  spent  a  morning  with  us  hunting  big  game\nin  the  second-hand  bookstores,  and  at  Porter  he  bought\nan  old,  dried-out  volume  with  a  torn  binding  for  which  he\npaid  what  would  have  been  his  salary  for  two  months  at\nthe  consulate  in  Rangoon.  He  moved  through  the  crowd\nlike  an  invalid  elephant,  with  a  child’s  curiosity  in  the\ninner workings of each thing he saw, for the world appeared\nto him as an immense wind-up toy with which life invented\nitself.\nI  have  never  known  anyone  closer  to  the  idea  one  has\nof  a  Renaissance  pope:  He  was  gluttonous  and  refined.\nEven  against  his  will,  he  always  presided  at  the  table.\nMatilde,  his  wife,  would  put  a  bib  around  his  neck  that\nbelonged in a barbershop rather than a dining room, but it\nwas the only way to keep him from taking a bath in sauce.\nThat  day  at  Carvalleiras  was  typical.  He  ate  three  whole\nlobsters, dissecting them with a surgeon’s skill, and at the\nsame  time  devoured  everyone  else’s  plate  with  his  eyes\nand  tasted  a  little  from  each  with  a  delight  that  made  the\ndesire to eat contagious: clams from Galicia, mussels from\nCantabria,  prawns  from  Alicante,  sea  cucumbers  from  the\nCosta  Brava.  In  the  meantime,  like  the  French,  he  spoke\nof  nothing  but  other  culinary  delicacies,  in  particular  the\nprehistoric shellfish of Chile, which he carried in his heart.\nAll at once he stopped eating, tuned his lobster’s antennae,\nand  said  to  me  in  a  very  quiet  voice:\n‘There’s someone behind me who won’t stop looking at\nme.’\nReprint 2025-26","7/I SELL MY DREAMS\nI  glanced  over  his  shoulder,  and  it  was  true.  Three\ntables  away  sat  an  intrepid  woman  in  an  old-fashioned\nfelt hat and a purple scarf, eating without haste and staring\nat  him.  I  recognised  her  right  away.  She  had  grown  old\nand fat, but it was Frau Frieda, with the snake ring on her\nindex  finger.\nShe  was  travelling  from  Naples  on  the  same  ship  as\nNeruda  and  his  wife,  but  they  had  not  seen  each  other  on\nboard.  We  invited  her  to  have  coffee  at  our  table,  and  I\nencouraged her to talk about her dreams in order to astound\nthe poet. He paid no attention, for from the very beginning\nhe  had  announced  that  he  did  not  believe  in  prophetic\ndreams.\n‘Only  poetry  is  clairvoyant,’  he  said.\nAfter  lunch,  during  the  inevitable  stroll  along  the\nRamblas, I lagged behind with Frau Frieda so that we could\nrenew  our  memories  with  no  other  ears  listening.  She  told\nme  she  had  sold  her  properties  in  Austria  and  retired  to\nOporto,  in  Portugal,  where  she  lived  in  a  house  that  she\ndescribed  as  a  fake  castle  on  a  hill,  from  which  one  could\nsee all the way across the ocean to the Americas. Although\nshe  did  not  say  so,  her  conversation  made  it  clear  that,\ndream  by  dream,  she  had  taken  over  the  entire  fortune  of\nher  ineffable  patrons  in  Vienna.  That  did  not  surprise  me,\nhowever,  because  I  had  always  thought  her  dreams  were\nno  more  than  a  stratagem  for  surviving.  And  I  told  her  so.\nShe laughed her irresistible laugh. ‘You’re as impudent\nas  ever,’  she  said.  And  said  no  more,  because  the  rest  of\nthe  group  had  stopped  to  wait  for  Neruda  to  finish  talking\nin  Chilean  slang  to  the  parrots  along  the  Rambla  de  los\nPájaros.  When  we  resumed  our  conversation,  Frau  Frieda\nchanged  the  subject.\n‘By  the  way,’  she  said,  ‘you  can  go  back  to  Vienna\nnow.’\nOnly then did I realise that thirteen years had gone by\nsince  our  first  meeting.\n‘Even if your dreams are false, I’ll never go back,’ I told\nher.  ‘Just  in  case.’\nAt three o’clock we left her to accompany Neruda to his\nsacred  siesta,  which  he  took  in  our  house  after  solemn\nReprint 2025-26","8/KALEIDOSCOPE\npreparations  that  in  some  way  recalled  the  Japanese  tea\nceremony. Some windows had to be opened and others closed\nto  achieve  the  perfect  degree  of  warmth,  and  there  had  to\nbe  a  certain  kind  of  light  from  a  certain  direction,  and\nabsolute  silence.  Neruda  fell  asleep  right  away,  and  woke\nten  minutes  later,  as  childr\nen  do,  when  we  least  expected\nit.  He  appeared  in  the  living  room  refreshed,  and  with  the\nmonogram  of  the  pillowcase  imprinted  on  his  cheek.\n‘I  dreamed  about  that  woman  who  dreams,’  he  said.\nMatilde  wanted  him  to  tell  her  his  dream.\n‘I  dreamed  she  was  dreaming  about  me,’  he  said.\n‘That’s  right  out  of  Borges,’  I  said.\nHe  looked  at  me  in  disappointment.\n‘Has  he  written  it  already?’\n‘If  he  hasn’t  he’ll  write  it  sometime,’  I  said.  ‘It  will  be\none  of  his  labyrinths.’\nAs soon as he boarded the ship at six that evening, Neruda\ntook his leave of us, sat down at an isolated table, and began\nto  write  fluid  verses  in  the  green  ink  he  used  for  drawing\nflowers  and  fish  and  birds  when  he  dedicated  his  books.  At\nthe first ‘All ashore’ we looked for Frau Frieda, and found her\nat  last  on  the  tourist  deck,  just  as  we  were  about  to  leave\nwithout  saying  good-bye.  She  too  had  taken  a  siesta.\n‘I  dreamed  about  the  poet,’  she  said.\nIn  astonishment  I  asked  her  to  tell  me  her  dream.\n‘I  dreamed  he  was  dreaming  about  me,’  she  said,  and\nmy  look  of  amazement  disconcerted  her.  ‘What  did  you\nexpect?
