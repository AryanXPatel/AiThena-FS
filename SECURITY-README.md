# üö® CRITICAL: API Keys Secured Again

I noticed you had added new API keys that were exposed. I've secured them again:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Configure Your API Keys Locally

To run the project locally, you need to add your actual API keys to the `.env` files:

1. **Get Google Gemini API Key**: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. **Add to each .env file**:
   ```bash
   # Replace "your_gemini_api_key_here" with your actual key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...your_actual_key_here
   ```

## üîß Document Intelligence Fix

**The Error**: Qdrant vector database had corrupted data causing the chat errors.

**The Solution**: 
1. Cleared corrupted `qdrant_storage` directory
2. Restart Qdrant with Docker:
   ```bash
   cd DocIntel-Backend
   docker compose up -d
   ```
3. Upload documents again to re-index them

## ‚úÖ All .env Files Are in .gitignore

Your API keys are safe and won't be pushed to GitHub!
